# bsky-username

**NOTE:** this fork is specifically for the enby.club domain. if you want to do this with your own domain, probably use [upstream](https://gitub.com/tendstofortytwo/bsky-username) instead which doesn't have an existing db.json.

## add your username to enby.club

submit a PR to this repository, adding a line like this:

```
	"yourusername.enby.club": "did:plc:your-bluesky-did-from-the-custom-settings-page"
```

once the PR merges, you can add your handle in settings (using the "No DNS Panel" option).
